PART I: Constitution of India — Rights, Duties, Directive Principles

"We, the people of India, having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a Sovereign Socialist Secular Democratic Republic and to secure to all its citizens:
Justice, social, economic and political;
Liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship;
Equality of status and of opportunity;

and to promote among them all Fraternity assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the Nation; … do hereby adopt, enact and give to ourselves this Constitution."
In simple terms: The Preamble is like an introduction that states the basic character of India: a sovereign (not subject to external authority), socialist, secular, democratic republic. It indicates core values — justice, liberty, equality, fraternity — which the rest of the Constitution is meant to uphold. It doesn't by itself give legal rights, but it guides how courts interpret the Constitution.”

Article 12
Article 12: Definition of “the State”

(Official text summary)
In this Part (Part III, Fundamental Rights), unless the context otherwise requires, “the State” includes the Government and Parliament of India, the Government and Legislature of each State, and all local or other authorities within the territory of India or under the control of the Government of India.
In simple terms: When the Constitution (in the part about Fundamental Rights) says that the State must or must not do something, “State” is broadly defined. It includes central and state governments, local bodies, and authorities under their control. So citizens’ rights constrain not just the central government, but many agencies and bodies of government.
Article 13
Article 13: Laws inconsistent with or in derogation of Fundamental Rights

(Official text summary)
A “law” includes statutes, orders, rules, regulations, custom or usage having force of law.
Any law in force (i.e. before the Constitution came into effect) that is inconsistent with Fundamental Rights is void to the extent of the inconsistency.
The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by Part III (Fundamental Rights); any law made in contravention is void.
In simple terms: If a law (new or old) violates a Fundamental Right, that part of the law is invalid/void. The State cannot pass laws that take away or reduce people’s Fundamental Rights. This is the constitutional “check” on legislative power.
Article 14
Article 14: Equality before law / equal protection of laws

(Official text excerpt)
“The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India.”
In simple terms: Everyone, regardless of social status, wealth, caste, religion, or background, must be treated equally by the law. The State cannot discriminate arbitrarily. For example, a law cannot single out a particular group without reasonable basis. If a rule treats two persons differently, the differentiation must have a rational/justifiable basis.
Article 15
Article 15: Prohibition of discrimination

(Official text summary)
The State shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth, or any of them.
No citizen shall, on these grounds, be subjected to any disability, liability, restriction or condition regarding:

  (a) access to shops, public restaurants, hotels, places of public entertainment;

  (b) use of wells, tanks, bathing ghats, roads;

  (c) employment under State;

  (d) admission to educational institutions (public).
The State may make special provisions for women, children, socially and educationally backward classes, Scheduled Castes / Tribes.
Nothing in this article prevents the State from making any special provision for advancement of these classes.
In simple terms: The government cannot discriminate against citizens on certain basic grounds (religion, caste, sex, birthplace). But it can make positive or affirmative provisions (reservations, special schemes) for disadvantaged groups (e.g. SC/ST). Example: A government school cannot refuse admission to a child because of caste; but the government may provide reserved seats for SC/ST students.
Article 16
Article 16: Equality of opportunity in public employment

(Official text summary)
There shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters of public employment (appointments, promotions) under the State.

However, Parliament may make law prescribing residence qualifications for certain offices.
Special provisions may be made for SC/ST, backward classes in employment or posts.
In simple terms: When the government hires for public jobs (e.g. government department, public sector), it must treat aspirants equally without arbitrary discrimination. But the government is allowed to provide reserved positions and affirmative action for disadvantaged classes.
Article 17
Article 17: Abolition of “untouchability”

(Official text excerpt)
“Untouchability” is abolished and its practice in any form is forbidden. The enforcement of any disability arising out of “untouchability” shall be an offence punishable in accordance with law.
In simple terms: The practice of treating certain persons as “untouchable” (i.e. excluding them socially, denying rights) is banned. Not only is this morally wrong, but it's a punishable offense. For instance, preventing a person from entering a temple because of caste is illegal.

Article 18: Abolition of titles

(Official text summary)
No titles (such as “Raja”, “Rai Bahadur”, etc.) shall be conferred by the State.
No citizen shall accept a title from a foreign State.
Nothing prevents the State from awarding military or academic distinctions.

(Official text summary)

Restrictions: The State may restrict these freedoms on grounds such as sovereignty & integrity of India, security of the State, public order, decency, morality, friendly relations with foreign states, contempt of court, defamation, incitement to an offense.
In simple terms: You can speak your mind, assemble peacefully, move around, choose a job, start a profession. But these freedoms are not absolute — the government can impose restrictions if it is necessary and reasonable (for security, public safety, etc.). For example, there may be restrictions on speech that incites violence.
Article 20
Article 20: Protection in respect of conviction for offences

(Official text summary)

You can’t be forced to give evidence against yourself (you can remain silent).
Article 21
Article 21: Protection of life and personal liberty

(Official text excerpt)
“No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law.”
In simple terms: No one can take away your life or freedom (e.g. lock you up) unless the law allows it, and it follows a fair and just process.

In simple terms: If your Fundamental Rights are violated, you can go directly to the Supreme Court and ask for orders (writs). This is called constitutional remedy — it gives teeth to Fundamental Rights. For example, if someone is illegally detained, you can bring a habeas corpus petition.
Directive Principles of State Policy (Articles 36–51)
Overview of key Directive Principles

(Official summary)
These are non-justiciable (cannot be enforced by courts), but the State should aim to implement them.

Fundamental Duties (Article 51A)
Article 51A: Fundamental Duties

(Official text excerpt)
It shall be the duty of every citizen of India —

(a) to abide by the Constitution and respect its ideals and institutions, the National Flag and the National Anthem;

(b) to cherish and follow the noble ideals which inspired our national struggle for freedom;

(c) to uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity, and integrity of India;

(d) to defend the country and render national service when called upon to do so;

(e) to promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood among all people, transcending religious, linguistic, regional or sectional diversities;

(f) to value and preserve the rich heritage of our composite culture;

(g) to protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers and wildlife, and to have compassion for living creatures;

Key Constitutional Amendments and Concepts
44th Amendment (1978)
44th Amendment – Key effects

Restored fundamental rights curtailed during Emergency, tightened provisions for preventive detention.
Made right to property a legal right (not a Fundamental Right).
Protected Article 21 and 22 more strongly from dilution.
In simple terms: This amendment rebalanced powers after the excesses during Emergency (1975–’77). It tried to ensure that rights relating to life and liberty have firmer protection.

Basic Structure Doctrine (Kesavananda Bharati case)
Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973)

(Case summary)
The Supreme Court held that Parliament cannot amend the “basic structure” of the Constitution (the essential skeletal features).
Even though Parliament has wide powers to amend (Art. 368), this power is not unlimited.
In simple terms: There are certain features (democracy, secularism, rule of law, separation of powers, fundamental rights) that the Constitution regards as “core.” Parliament cannot pass an amendment that destroys them. This doctrine protects the Constitution’s identity.
PART II: Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) / Indian Penal Code (IPC) — Major Sections
Note: In 2023, the Indian Parliament passed the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 (BNS) to replace and modernize criminal law provisions in India, aligning with justice, not just punishment. Wikipedia Many of the traditional IPC sections have corresponding BNS sections. (A correspondence table exists. BPRD) Below is a selection of the most important and commonly encountered offences, with explanations in simple language.
Introductory / General Provisions
Section 1 (Title, extent) [IPC / BNS equivalent]
Section 1 IPC / BNS equivalent

(Statutory / official text summary)

It also applies to certain extraterritorial offences (e.g. acts on Indian ships / aircraft, or offences outside aimed at computer resource in India). India Code+2Home Page | IIT Kanpur+2
In simple terms: This law sets out what acts are crimes and punishments. If an act happens in India, it generally falls under this Code. Sometimes acts done abroad may also be punishable if they affect India.

Section 2 to 52 (General Explanations)
These sections define terms used in the Code (like “accused,” “person,” “death,” “public servant,” etc.), and specify how to interpret acts, omissions, etc.
In simple terms: These are definitions and rules of interpretation. For example, what is “voluntarily,” “malice,” etc. If you read a criminal section, these help you understand exactly what the statute means.
